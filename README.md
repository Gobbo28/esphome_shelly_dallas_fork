# Shelly Temperature Add-On for ESPHome
Experimental Fork of Shelly Dallas Temperature for ESPHome by persuader72

Since the last version by persuader72 hasn't been compatible to the current Branch of ESPHome I tried to make some corrections inside the Code, to make it work.
You might still get some Warnings about deprecated components but for the moment it should work.

As I just said, this is really experimental and is not recommended for production usage.
